### Phase 4: Risk Assessment (Portfolio Risk Management Advisor)

**Objective**: Quantify portfolio risk and optimize allocation

**Analysis**:

**Portfolio Scenario**: $1M, TSM 50%, AMD 30%, ARM 20%

**Risk Metrics**:
- Annualized Volatility: 22.4% (High)
- 95% VaR (1-day): -$32,100
- Max Drawdown: -38.2%
- Sharpe Ratio: 1.78 (Good)
- Sortino Ratio: 2.45 (Excellent)

**Stress Tests**:
| Scenario | Portfolio Impact |
|----------|-----------------|
| Taiwan Strait Crisis | -26.5% (-$265K) |
| AI Bubble Burst | -38% (-$380K) |
| 2008-Style Crash | -41% (-$410K) |

**Concentration Risk**:
- Single stock (TSM): 50% ⚠️ Over limit (target <40%)
- Sector (Semiconductors): 80% 🔴 High risk
- Geography (Taiwan): 50% 🔴 High risk

**Recommendations**:
1. 🔴 Reduce TSM to 40% (sell $100K)
2. 🔴 Increase cash to 30% for crisis buffer
3. ⚠️ Add non-correlated assets (ASML, Micron)
4. ✅ Set hedging (Put options on TSM 5%)

**Optimized Allocation**:
- TSM: 40% (reduced risk)
- AMD: 30%
- ARM: 10% (minimal)
- Cash: 20% (safety buffer)

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Return: 24.8% (vs 26.2% original)
- Volatility: 18.5% (vs 22.4% original)
- Sharpe: 2.05 (improved)
- Max Drawdown: -28% (vs -38% original)

**Deliverable**: Risk assessment report with stress scenarios

### Phase 5: Integrated Recommendation (Investment Report Coordinator)

**Objective**: Synthesize all analyses into actionable plan

**Conflict Resolution**:

**AMD Paradox**: Technical 8/10 (strong) vs Valuation concerns (P/E 57x)
- **Resolution**: Include AMD but at lower allocation (30% vs TSM 50%)
- **Logic**: Short-term (30 days) prioritizes technicals, but reduce size for risk

**ARM Decision**: Technical 7/10 vs Fundamental 6.5/10
- **Resolution**: AVOID completely
- **Logic**: Risk/reward ratio poor (1:1), better alternatives exist

**Final Scoring**:

| Stock | Technical (40%) | Fundamental (20%) | Catalysts (30%) | Risk (10%) | **Total** |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| TSM | 10 × 0.4 = 4.0 | 9.5 × 0.2 = 1.9 | 9 × 0.3 = 2.7 | 9 × 0.1 = 0.9 | **9.45** ✅ |
| AMD | 8 × 0.4 = 3.2 | 7.5 × 0.2 = 1.5 | 8 × 0.3 = 2.4 | 7 × 0.1 = 0.7 | **7.90** ⚠️ |
| ARM | 7 × 0.4 = 2.8 | 6.5 × 0.2 = 1.3 | 6 × 0.3 = 1.8 | 6 × 0.1 = 0.6 | **6.60** ❌ |

**Probability of 30% Target**:
- TSM: 85% (Bull 30% × +40%, Base 50% × +25%, Bear 20% × -6%)
- AMD: 65% (Highly dependent on Feb 3 earnings)
- ARM: 35% (Too risky, avoid)

## Key Success Factors

**5 Must-Haves for 30% Target**:

1. ✅ **Technical Alignment**: TSM/AMD maintain bullish patterns
2. ✅ **Earnings Beats**: AMD (Feb 3), NVIDIA (Feb 26) exceed expectations
3. ✅ **Catalyst Materialization**: AI demand remains robust
4. ✅ **Geopolitical Stability**: No Taiwan Strait escalation
5. ✅ **Discipline**: Strict stop-loss and profit-taking execution

**All 5 Met** → 85% success probability  
**4 Met** → 60% probability  
**3 or Less** → <40% (abort mission)

## Lessons Learned

### What Made This Analysis Excellent

1. **Multi-Dimensional Framework**: Not just technicals OR fundamentals, but weighted integration
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Addressed AMD's technical vs valuation contradiction transparently
3. **Scenario Planning**: Bull/Base/Bear with probabilities (not just bullish bias)
4. **Risk Quantification**: VaR, stress tests, concentration limits (not vague "high risk" warnings)
5. **Actionable Timeline**: Specific dates, prices, actions (not generic advice)

### Common Pitfalls Avoided

❌ **Over-reliance on Single Metric**: Didn't buy ARM just because P/E is low  
❌ **Ignoring Risk**: Calculated max drawdown before entry  
❌ **Confirmation Bias**: Rejected ARM despite technical score of 7/10  
❌ **Vague Recommendations**: Gave exact entry ($337-342), stop ($333), target ($445)
